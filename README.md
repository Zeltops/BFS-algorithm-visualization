## Description
A simple program using PyGame to visualize the BFS algorithm.

## How to use
1. Left click to select a starting point(the square will be colored cyan blue)
2. After that click or hold the left mouse button to create walls(blocks which the algorithm can't pass)
3. Right click to set a target(the square will be colored gold)
4. Press any key to run
5. Click reset to restart the program
